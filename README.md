# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# NextForge - React to Next.js Converter

## Overview
*NextForge*  
A migration tool that converts React applications to Next.js frameworks through automated processes and intelligent analysis

## Core Features
### Conversion Engine
- Automated React-to-Next.js code transformation
- File structure generation following Next.js conventions
- Component adaptation for Next.js compatibility

### Routing System
- React Router detection and conversion
- Automatic page creation in /pages or /app directory

### Project Analysis
- Code structure diagnostics
- Dependency mapping and compatibility checks
- Validation system (Zod integration)

### Output Management
- Browser-based file upload/download interface
- ZIP package generation (JSZip integration)
- Visual project structure preview

## Technical Architecture
### Core Technologies
- React (UI Framework)
- TypeScript (Language)
- Vite (Build Tool)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- shadcn/ui (Component Library)

### Key Processes
1. File ingestion via drag & drop/selection
2. AST-based code analysis
3. Route mapping transformation
4. File structure reorganization
5. Dependency manifest updating
6. ZIP package compilation

## User Workflow
1. *Input*  
   - Upload React project (ZIP/file tree)
2. *Processing*  
   - Automatic code conversion
   - Route transformation
3. *Output*  
   - Preview converted structure
   - Download Next.js project package
   - Receive dependency recommendations

## Development Stack
### Frontend
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn components
- File upload handlers
- Project structure visualizer

### Backend Processing
- Code transformation engine
- Routing system adapter
- Dependency analyzer
- Validation layer (Zod)
- ZIP packaging system (JSZip)

## Conversion Targets
- JSX → Next.js page components
- React Router → Next.js routing
- Webpack/Vite config → Next.js config
- CSS-in-JS → CSS Modules/Tailwind
- State management adaptation
- API route migration
